Kevin Quinn, Vinod Rathnam, Sonja Khan, Riley Porter {kchq, vinodr, sonjak3, rileymp2}@uw.edu

The research process took place in person all together.  We searched for relevant works, possible data sets, and ideas on interesting features in the Hip Hop data visualization realm.  Then two team members, Sonja and Kevin, worked on scraping the data from the MusicBrainz API.  The other two team members, Vinod and Riley, worked on the project milestone presentation.

After that, the development process started.  In general, we each picked different features that we wanted to work on and separately developed them.  However, we did this with a lot of communication via Facebook chat and met in person many times to work alongside each other and ask each other questions.   As a result of this, we would sometimes naturally end up working on features in pairs based on how integrated our solo features were.  Based on how many views we ended up creating, there were plenty of features to work on at all times.
